This project is a Python script that posts measurement comment posts to DeSo backend nodes, times the performance of each post, and schedules posts every x minutes. It also creates a daily main post with graphs and gauges visualizing node performance. Use the deso-python-sdk for all DeSo interactions. Scheduling, data collection, and graph/gauge generation are required.
