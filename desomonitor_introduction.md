🚀 **Introducing DeSoMonitor: Real-Time DeSo Network Performance Tracking**

Hey DeSo community! 👋 

I'm excited to share **DeSoMonitor** - an automated monitoring system that tracks and visualizes the performance of DeSo nodes in real-time. This tool helps our community understand network health and node performance across the ecosystem.

## 🎯 **What is DeSoMonitor?**

DeSoMonitor is an automated bot that:
- ⚡ Tests transaction speeds across multiple DeSo nodes every 10 minutes
- 📊 Generates performance charts and gauges 
- 📈 Posts daily summaries with visual analytics
- 🔍 Tracks both POST speed (submission) and CONFIRMATION speed (commitment)

## 📋 **How It Works**

**Every 10 Minutes:**
1. 🔄 Submits test transactions to monitored nodes
2. ⏱️ Measures POST speed (how fast transactions are accepted)
3. ⏳ Measures CONFIRMATION speed (how fast they're committed to blockchain)
4. 📤 Posts results as individual measurement posts

**Daily at Midnight UTC:**
1. 📊 Generates dual-metric performance graphs showing trends
2. 🎯 Creates horizontal bar gauge comparing node speeds  
3. 📸 Uploads charts as images (using our new SDK image upload feature!)
4. 📋 Posts comprehensive daily summary with visual analytics

## 🌐 **Monitored Nodes**
- **node.deso.org** (Official DeSo node)
- **desocialworld.desovalidator.net** (Community validator)
- **safetynet.social** (Community node)

## 📊 **What You'll See**

**Individual Measurements:**
```
🌐 Node Performance RESULT
POST: 0.32s | CONFIRM: 7.29s | TOTAL: 7.61s
Timestamp: 2025-07-26 10:07:50 UTC
Node: https://node.deso.org
#desomonitormeasurement
```

**Daily Summaries:**
- 📈 Performance trend graphs (POST vs CONFIRMATION speeds)
- 🎯 Horizontal bar gauge comparing all nodes
- 📊 Visual analytics showing network health patterns
- 🏆 Performance rankings and insights

## 🔧 **Technical Features**

- **Dual-Metric Tracking**: Separate measurement of submission vs confirmation speeds
- **Visual Analytics**: Automated chart generation with matplotlib
- **Image Upload**: Uses our new DeSo Python SDK image upload functionality
- **Error Resilience**: Continues monitoring even if individual nodes are slow
- **Production Ready**: Running 24/7 on dedicated server infrastructure

## 🎁 **Value to Community**

**For Users:**
- 🔍 Understand which nodes perform best
- 📈 Track network performance trends
- ⚡ Make informed decisions about node selection

**For Node Operators:**
- 📊 Monitor your node's performance vs others
- 🔧 Identify performance issues early
- 🏆 Showcase your node's reliability

**For Developers:**
- 📋 Reference implementation for DeSo monitoring
- 🛠️ Example of automated posting with images
- 💡 Open source code for learning and contribution

## 🚀 **Innovation Highlight**

DeSoMonitor is also the **first production implementation** of our new image upload functionality for the DeSo Python SDK! The daily charts you see are uploaded directly to DeSo's media service using JWT authentication - a feature we've contributed back to the ecosystem.

## 📊 **Follow Along**

Watch for:
- 🔄 Regular measurement posts every 10 minutes
- 📅 Daily summaries at midnight UTC with charts
- 📈 Performance trends and network insights
- 🎯 Node performance comparisons

## 🤝 **Open Source**
